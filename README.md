# ZKM-Phase1
ZKM Early Contributor Program Phase 1

Early Contributor Program (ECP) illuminates the path to understanding and harnessing the groundbreaking potential of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology and the zkVM that we are building.

This is a demo implementation of ZKMIPS for Community Education purposes, which serves as Phase 1 of the ZKM Early Contributor Program(ECP).

The demo implementation uses the Cannon simulator, Zokrates DSL, and Groth16. It supports the full execution of Minigeth, outputs the entire instruction sequence, generates proofs for each instruction, and submits them to an on-chain contract for verification.

My verification transaction is https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xce1b170a15d03db1a32b0c75e7188af1c2786463e1f7b3c4893249174b6ba279

Generated proof number is 42046.
